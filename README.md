# Intermittent Empty req.body in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Express.js where the request body (req.body) is sometimes empty or undefined, even when a POST request is sent with valid JSON data.  The issue is often intermittent, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

An Express.js server inconsistently fails to parse the JSON body of incoming POST requests. This leads to req.body being empty, causing unexpected behavior in request handlers.

## Solution

The problem stems from a missing or incorrectly configured body-parsing middleware. The solution involves ensuring that `express.json()` is used correctly, potentially with configuration options to handle different request sizes or content types.  The example shows a robust solution that handles potential errors during parsing.
